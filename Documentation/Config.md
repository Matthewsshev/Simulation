	Class Trips:
List autos[]:

Defines which transport modes our person can use.
__init__ function:

Determines if our person will have a vehicle. You can also decide if they will have multiple vehicles or none at all.
create_trips function:

This function allows you to define how long stops will last.
pedestrian_retrieval function:

You can modify the transport ID in the database.
You can also choose which data about the person will be stored in the database.
autos_retrieval function:

Allows you to choose which information about the transport will be saved in the database.
delete_all function:

Allows you to decide which data from the last simulation should be deleted from the database.
	Class Human and its subclasses:
__init__ function:
You can change the personal details of people, such as their name, home, work, university, school, park, friends' places, age, salary, pocket money, or scholarship.
Main Function:
Define the number of people:

You can modify the quantity variable to set how many people will be simulated.
Categorizing people:

Define how many will be workers, students, pupils, or seniors by adjusting values in the if statements.
Number of trips per person:

Change the quantityTrips value to set how many trips each person will take in the simulation.
Simulation time:

	The overall simulation time can be set in the final while statement.
Traffic Adjustment for Realism:
To make the simulation more realistic, especially when simulating a small population (e.g., 10 people), roads may appear empty. A solution is to create background traffic by adding non-user vehicles. The trips.trips.xml file, generated using randomTrips.py, includes 50 ‘flows’. By adjusting the period='x' value, the number of cars on the road changes. The period defines how often (in seconds) a new car starts a trip. For larger simulations, like with 500 people, you might reduce the number of vehicles to avoid overcrowding.
